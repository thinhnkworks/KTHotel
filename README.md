# PrimeHotel---Private
A .Net 5 implementation of a hotel management system. Project was created for learning programming in ASP.NET Core for .NET 5 and Entity Framework Core 5.

This project uses a MS SQL Server database, so you would need to create one to run in.
A short tutorial for running this project is available at my blog: http://www.michalbialecki.com/2020/06/28/primehotel-how-to-run-this-project/
